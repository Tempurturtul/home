## In-Progress Development Notes

- Finish and host API server so it can be used during client development.
	- **DO NOT LET USER SET CREATED AND UPDATED TIMES IN BLOG POST CREATE API. SET THEM ON THE SERVER.**
- Consider using `axios` to make API calls from client.
	- See the [Data Fetching](https://router.vuejs.org/en/advanced/data-fetching.html) article in Vue Router's docs.
